# Space News Website

## Project Description

This project is a Space News Website that fetches and displays the latest space news articles using the [Spaceflight News API](https://spaceflightnewsapi.net/). It is built with React and uses a [pre-built Bootstrap theme for styling](https://themefisher.com/products/galaxy).

The application uses the following components and functions to fetch, process, and display the data:

- `useDataApi`: A custom hook to fetch data from the API using React hooks and a reducer.
- `dataFetchReducer`: A reducer function to manage the state of the fetched data.
- `App`: The main component that renders the fetched data and handles user interactions.
- `handleDate`: A custom function for parsing dates to be more human readable.

The project is designed to be easily adaptable and extensible for future enhancements.
